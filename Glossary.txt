- Sprite => 2D graphics object that uses textures
-- It's like a flat mesh with textures applied
- Mesh => Describes the shape of the object
- UV => 2D fold out of the 3D mesh
-- Values from 0 to 1 to create the triangles
-- The UVs are the coordinates to where the sprite lives on the texture
-- In my case, if I repeat a sprite, it's using the same UV coordinates, but placing it at a different location on the mesh
- Material => Describes the surface of the object
-- e.g. make the object look like wood, brick, glass, etc.
- Shaders => perform calculations on how to render meshes
- Lerp => Linear Interpolation
